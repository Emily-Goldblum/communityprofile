<h1>On the Way to Normalizing Perceptions Towards LGBT People</h1>
<p class="lead">Acceptance is growing nation-wide; through marriage and anti-discrimination laws. While there has been major head-way towards normalizing ideas of homosexuality, many steps still need to be taken. Anti-gay organizations are working twice as hard to slow this progress down - even in states where marriage of same-sex couples has already been accepted. </p>

The median age for coming out and being confident of your sexual orientation were pretty even across the board for all categories polled. Most people polled start to think they knew of of their sexual orientation by their early teens, told someone as teenagers, and were confident with their sexual identities by their late teens or early twenties. Overall, gay men were most comfortable about coming out at the youngest ages, and lesbians tended to wait a few years longer than the others.

<p>Most of your content will end up here: inside the Bootstrap "container" div, but outside the "jumbotron". Bootstrap has some classes that make some basic layout things a whole lot easier. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes-floats">Quickfloats</a> are handy for pullquotes. You can let them find their own size or use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid">the grid</a> to set their width.</p>
<p>Bootstrap does a lot of fancy footwork to customize layouts on tiny, small, medium and large screens. For now, I suggest that you stick to the <code>col-md-</code> classes. They're the most universal. Our goal here is to tell good stories, not master the finer points of CSS layout, with or without Bootstrap.</p>
<p>We didn't talk much about  <code>blockquote</code>

<p>This is my content. There's a lot of it. On small screens it should be in the in middle. On medium screens, it should be on the right.</p>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
