<b><h1>Shifting Perceptions Towards Acceptance of LGBT Community</h1></b>
<p class="lead"> LGBT advocacy groups have worked towards the enactment of marriage and anti-discrimination laws, achieving major victories in equal rights, especially same-sex marriage. 

<p>While acceptance of this group is growing nationwide, the fight for equality is far from over. Heavily funded anti-gay organizations are attempting to thwart this progress, 
including in states where same-sex marriage has already been legalized.</p>

<p> Every year, specifically since 2001, recognition of the LGBT community has gradually 
increased among Americans. According to the Pew Research Center, there has been a significant rise in acceptance in the past five years.</p>
<align='left'>
<div><p>Currently, 37 states have legalized same-sex marriage. However,
married same-sex couples are listed as married in every state, regardless of laws the state 
may have passed. This could mean the couples
have been married in other states and returned/moved to these states. The New York Times
posted an article in <a
href=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/21/upshot/the-metro-areas-with-the-largest-and-
smallest-gay-population.html?emc=edit_th_20150321&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=71628600&_r=0&
abt=0002&abg=0> Upshot </a> about the most popular and least popular metro areas for people
who identify as LGBT. 
<p> Predictably, San Francisco has the highest percentage (6.2%)
of its residents in this demographic, while Birmingham, Alabama has the lowest rate of
LGBT residents (2.6%). One noteworthy statistic is that 4.2 percent of Ohio’s population are
LGBT, despite the ban of same-sex marriage.  In 2003, the Buckeye State passed a bill called 
Ohio's Defense of Marriage Act, and in May of 2004, the Sixth Circuit ruled that Ohio's ban on 
same-sex marriage did not violate the constitution. In Louisville, KY, 4.7 percent of city dwellers 
are LGBT residents. In 2014, U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II
attempted to overturn the gay marriage ban in Kentucky, but it was overruled by a
three-judge panel of the Sixth US Circuit Court of Appeals. </p></div></align> </p>

<h2><b></b> Who Should Know? </h2></b>
<div> With the continuing increase in acceptance of same-sex marriage, and visibility of
the LGBT community in media, people are feeling confident about coming forward with their sexuality,
instead of hiding in shame as they had a few decades ago. Still - these same people are struggling with 
barriers anti-LGBT organizations are creating.

<b></b><p><h2>Who's Against Them and Why?</h2></p></b>
<div><p>
<p>While we have noted that the acceptance of marriage for same-sex couples is on the rise, 
there are numerous agencies attempting to ban or uphold bans against same-sex marriages across the U.S. 
Three such powerful anti-gay organizations are The Family Research Council, the American Family Association and Focus on the Family.

<p></div> 
Focus on the Family claims to <a href= http://www.focusonthefamily.com/about_us.aspx> "help families thrive" </a> and are adamant that marriage should be between husband and wife. 
They raised over <a href=http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/10-things-you-should-know-about-focus-on-the-family> $515 million </a> 
from 2008 - 2012 alone making them the most well-funded anti-LGBT organization in America. They released an 
article which claimed that the 
<a href= http://www.gallup.com/poll/147824/Adults-Estimate-Americans-Gay-Lesbian.aspx> Gallup polls from 2011, </a> regarding the amount of gays and lesbians in the U.S., are false. 
Jeff Johnson, the author of the article, said, "I think the reason most people overestimate their numbers are because gay- and lesbian-identified people have done
a terrific job of promoting their agenda over the past 40 years. This group is highly visible and wields much influence," Johnson <a href=http://www.focusonthefamily.com/socialissues/defending-your-values/how-to-talk-to-your-children-about-homosexuality/the-homosexual-community-small-number-big-influence> said. </a> He makes it clear that the population is much smaller than proved to be. The President of Focus on the Family, Jim Daley mentions marriage equality means the destruction of civilization. 
Since leaders of the anti-gay movement are saying such vile remarks about the LGBT community this helps push those who believe them to help fight back against the rights of LGBT people. 
They work hand in hand with other national organizations to point out where these LGBT safe spaces are.
   <p> <div> </div>
  </p>The virulently anti-gay American Family Association recently unveiled an 
  interactive map of U.S. LGBT, Humanist and Atheist organizations, ironically named the “Bigotry Map.” 
  The description for homosexuals is “Advocates for the legalization and promotion of same-sex marriage 
  and viciously attacks Christians who exercise their First Amendment right to voice support for God’s plan 
  for marriage as between one man and one woman.”

    The map is mainly locations of state chapters of the national organization Gay, 
    Lesbian & Straight Education Network, (GLSEN), as well as the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). 
    Both organizations work to achieve equality for the LGBT community. GLSEN is the largest national 
    organization of parents, educators, students and allies. HRC is the largest national LGBT advocacy 
    organization working to ensure equal rights.Most recently, 
    HRC created the <a href=http://www.thepeoplesbrief.com/> People’s Brief </a> which collected 
    the most signatories than any other amicus brief submitted to the Supreme Court.

          HRC, GLSEN and other organizations working towards equality are marked as the “Gay Agenda.” 
          <p> <p>
          The gay agenda (also known as the homosexual agenda) is a term that means LGBT people recruiting others to become LGBT. 
          AFA states,
        "We accept that there will always be noisy enemies of God."</div>  </center>

<h3><b></b></h3>>Reasoning Behind Homophobia</h3></b>
<a href="http://imgur.com/nyher3s"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nyher3s.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
 <div> <p> <cite>Source: Pew Research Center </cite></p>
 
<p>According to the <a
href=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/american-family-
association> Southern Poverty Law Center, </a> the American Family Association "says it
promotes 'traditional moral values' in media. A large part of that work involves
'combating the homosexual agenda.'"
This anti-gay organization is currently making <a
href-http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/25/american-family-association-bigotry-map-
_n_6754528.html> headlines </a> for their interactive map of US based LGBT, Humanist and
Atheist organizations, ironically called the “Bigotry Map.”

<p>This is just a small example of what the American Family Association is standing behind. Some other examples might include: <p>
1. Indiana very recently passed a <a href=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/27/politics/indiana-religous-freedom-explainer/>bill </a> that makes sure the government cannot intrude on a person's religious liberty. 
</p> <p> 
2. When Governor Pence signed this law a picture was taken revealing the head of the American Family Association of Indiana, Micah Clark, standing next to him in support of the law. He makes it clear he's against LGBT having same-sex marriage rights.
On his <a href=http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/this_one_photo_is_all_you_need_to_prove_mike_pence_is_surrounded_by_professional_anti_gay_activists> resume </a> Clark writes "homosexuality has no societal benefit...and its individually destructive and dangerous."</p>
</p> <p>
3. The AFA backed a law in Uganda which called for anyone that was LGBT or "promoting" homosexuality to be jailed, possibly for life. </p>

In an article by the Huffington Post, they quote Hayley Miller, the digital media
associate at HRC, who responded to the Bigotry map: "The AFA bills itself as being 'on the
frontlines of America’s culture war.' Sadly, however, the AFA, 'one of the largest and
most effective pro-family organizations in the country,' forgot to include one of the
largest bigoted organizations in America on the map: themselves." </p>

<h3><b></b> What's in the works? </h3></b>
<p> Every state in the U.S. has one or more organizations fighting for the LGBT community to have the same rights as heterosexuals. In addition to statewide organizations, there are about 80 local organizations also working towards equality, and the numbers continue to increase. While older coalitions such as Act Up focus specifically on the HIV/AIDs movement, organizations like GetEqual,
that formed in 2010, is taking bold actions towards demanding full equality, legally and socially.
