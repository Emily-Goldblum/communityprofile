<h1>Shifting Perceptions Towards Acceptance of LGBT People</h1>
<p class="lead">Acceptance of same-sex marriage and rights for LGBT people is growing
nationwide; through marriage and anti-discrimination laws. While there has been major
headway towards normalizing ideas the LGBT community within our society, many steps still
need to be taken. Anti-gay organizations are working twice as hard to slow this progress
down - even in states where same-sex marriage has already been legalized. </p>

<p> Every year acceptance is growing among women and men in the United States. According to Pew Research Center, there has been a significant increase in acceptance even in the past five years.</p>
<align='left'><div><p>Acceptance of same-sex couples is growing nationwide. Thirty-seven states have
legalized same-sex marriage, and married gay couples are listed as “married” in every
state, regardless of the bans the state may have against it. This could mean the couples
have been married in other states and returned/moved to these states. The New York Times
posted an article in <a
href=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/21/upshot/the-metro-areas-with-the-largest-and-
smallest-gay-population.html?emc=edit_th_20150321&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=71628600&_r=0&
abt=0002&abg=0> Upshot </a> about most popular and least popular metro areas for people
who identify as LGBT. Unsurprisingly, San Francisco has the highest percentage, with 6.2%
of its residents in this demographic, while Birmingham, Alabama has the lowest rate of
LGBT residents. One noteworthy statistic is that 4.2% of Ohio’s population population are
LGBT, despite same-sex marriage being banned their state law. <b> (We would like to survey
those in Ohio to see why so many LGBT people reside in a state that doesn't view their
marriage as legal.) </b> In 2003, a bill was passed
called Ohio's Defense of Marriage Act. In May of 2004, the Sixth Circuit ruled that the
Ohio's ban on same-sex marriage did not violate the constitution. Also, in Louisville, KY,
4.7% of city dwellers are LGBT residents. In 2014, U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II
attempted to overturn the gay marriage ban in Kentucky, but it was overruled by a
three-judge panel of the Sixth US Circuit Court of Appeals. </p></div></align>

While acceptance is growing nation-wide and 37 states accept same-sex marriage, same-sex
couples are listed as married in every state regardless of state laws.

<h2> Who Should Know? </h2>
<div> With the continuing increase in acceptance of same-sex marriage, and visibility of
the LGBT community in media, people are feeling confident about exploring their sexuality,
instead of suppressing their emotions. The growth of the LGBT community in studies doesn't
necessarily mean there are more queer people today; but that people are more comfortable
with revealing their sexuality.

<h3>Discrepancies in Age Between When Gay Men, Lesbians, and Bisexuals Come Out</h3>

<p>
The median age for coming out and being confident of your sexual orientation were
pretty even across the board for all categories polled. Most people polled start to think
they knew of of their sexual orientation by their early teens, told someone as teenagers,
and were confident with their sexual identities by their late teens or early twenties.
Overall, gay men were most comfortable about coming out at the youngest ages, and lesbians
tended to wait a few years longer than the others. </p>

<p><h2>Who's Against Them?</h2></p>
<div><p>
<p>While acceptance of marriage for same-sex couples is on the rise, there are a number of detractors
attempting to  ban or withhold bans against same-sex marriages in their states. Three such organizations are the powerful
anti-gay organizations; The Family Research Council, the American Family Association and Focus on the Family.
<p></div> 
Focus on the Family claims to <a href= http://www.focusonthefamily.com/about_us.aspx> "Help Families Thrive" </a> and are adamant that marriage should be between husband and wife. They raised over <a href=http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/10-things-you-should-know-about-focus-on-the-family> $515 million </a> from 2008 - 2012 alone making them the most well-funded anti-LGBT organization in America. They released an article regarding the amount of gays and lesbians in the U.S. 
The writer of the article, Jeff Johnson, feels that the polls by <a href= http://www.gallup.com/poll/147824/Adults-Estimate-Americans-Gay-Lesbian.aspx> Gallup from 2011 </a> are false. "I think the reason most people overestimate their numbers are because gay- and lesbian-identified people have done a terrific job of promoting their agenda over the past 40 years. This group is highly visible and wields much influence," Johnson <a href=http://www.focusonthefamily.com/socialissues/defending-your-values/how-to-talk-to-your-children-about-homosexuality/the-homosexual-community-small-number-big-influence> said. </a> He makes it clear that the population is much smaller than proved to be. The President of Focus on the Family, Jim Daley mentions marriage equality means the destruction of civilization. 
Since leaders of the anti-gay movement are saying such vile remarks about the LGBT community this helps push those who believe them to help fight back against the rights of LGBT people. 
They work hand in hand with other national organizations to point out where these LGBT safe spaces are.
   <p> 
    It’s ironic that the virulently anti-gay American Family Association named their
interactive project of locating LGBT, Humanist and Atheist organizations the “Bigotry
Map.” LGBT organizations are described as “Advocates for the legalization and promotion of
same-sex marriage and viciously attacks Christians who exercise their First Amendment
right to voice support for God’s plan for marriage as between one man and one woman.”
    On the East coast, it mainly maps out locations of state chapters of the national
organization Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network, known as GLSEN, as well as the
Human Rights Campaign, or HRC. Both organizations tirelessly work to achieve equality for
the LGBT community.

<h3> American Family Association's Bigotry Map </h3>

        <div class="entry_image_caption large-image-caption">Source: Google Maps.
        Human Rights Campaign, GLSEN and other organizations working towards equality are
marked as the Gay Agenda. AFA states, "We accept that there will always be noisy enemies
of God." </div>  

<p>According to the <a
href=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/american-family-
association> Southern Poverty Law Center, </a> the American Family Association "says it
promotes 'traditional moral values' in media. A large part of that work involves
'combating the homosexual agenda.'"
This virulently anti-gay organization is currently making <a
href-http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/25/american-family-association-bigotry-map-
_n_6754528.html> headlines </a> for their interactive map of US based LGBT, Humanist and
Atheist organizations, ironically called the “Bigotry Map.”

<p>Examples they've included are the state chapters of national organization such as the
Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network, or GLSEN, and the Human Rights Campaign, the
HRC, both which tirelessly work to achieve equality for the LGBT community. They are
described by the AFA as “Advocates for the legalization and promotion of same-sex marriage
and viciously attacks Christians who exercise their First Amendment right to voice support
for God’s plan for marriage as between one man and one woman.”</p>

Within the Huffington Post's article, they quote Hayley Miller, the digital media
associate from HRC, who responded to the map: "The AFA bills itself as being 'on the
frontlines of America’s culture war.' Sadly, however, the AFA, 'one of the largest and
most effective pro-family organizations in the country,' forgot to include one of the
largest bigoted organizations in America on the map: themselves," digital media associate
Hayley Miller wrote. </p>

<h3> What's in the works? </h3>
<p> There are international, country and state organizations that are fighting for same-sex couples and LGBT to have the same rights as heterosexual people. Every state in the U.S. has one or more organizations fighting for these rights. Without counting statewide organizations there are currently just under 80 orgs with the goal of equality. These numbers are growing. While there are older coalitions such as Act Up that focus specifically on the HIV/AIDs movement, there are organizations like GetEqual that was formed in 2010 taking bold action towards demanding full equality, legally and socially.
